## Turn Based Combat on a Grid
Combat occurs in a grid based arena separate from the open world exploration. Player characters and enemy units take actions in turns - the order determined by an unit's agility, which can change throughout a battle.  
On an unit's turn, they are able to take 1 movement action and 1 attack/item action. A movement action is done by moving the unit a limited number of grid tiles from their position, which is determined by their Stamina stat (?). An attack/item action is done by using any attack-based ability (Attack, Arts, Special), or by using any item.
